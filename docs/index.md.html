**External Validation of Display Latency in Chrome**

As part of my [Google Summer of Code 2022 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/RiwyAVic) to reduce presentation latency in Chrome on Windows, I wanted a way to measure the delay between when something is drawn by the user (e.g. in [requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) (rAF)) and when it actually appears on the screen.

# Design

I picked a fairly direct route. Using a phototransistor mounted directly to the monitor and a microcontroller (MCU) for communication, we should be able to get an idea of the presentation latency. Thanks to Chromium's support for the [WebHID API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API), the microcontroller can directly coordinate with the browser.

The general idea is this:

The difference in time between the clock reset and the rising edge of the phototransistor voltage *should* give us the total display latency in the system.



## Hardware

I used the following hardware:

 - 1x [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html)
 - 1x [HW5P-1 phototransistor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2831)
 - 1x 10k resistor
 - Misc wires, breadboards, etc. to put it all together

There are probably many other ways to achieve this same basic phenotype (a light-sensitive sensor + a device to interpret that data & communicate with the host computer).

I picked the Teensy 4.0 for a few reasons (beyond already having on hand):

 - It's a high-speed USB 2.0 device, meaning it can send & receive data with very low latency.
 - It has an onboard analog to digital converter (ADC), which is convenient.
 - It has an Arduino-compatible API, which makes it relatively easy for non-electronics people to get hooked up.
 - Great software support from Paul Stoffregen (the creator) & community. The [forums](https://forum.pjrc.com/) are an excellent resource.

The phototransistor was primarily selected because of:

 - Great rise/fall times (~2 Î¼s, according to the [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2831/HW5P-1_2015__1_.pdf))
 - Through hole part, so easy to solder/generally manipulate by hand
 - Minimal supporting circuitry required-- just one resistor!

 ![Circuit schematic](schem.png width="160px") The physical connections are straightforward, mostly boiling down to getting the long & short legs of the phototransistor the right way around (long leg connects to Vcc). This is a [common-collector amplifier](https://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/AN-3005-D.PDF), which has a low voltage output in the dark and high in the light.

The other bit you may want to do is shield the phototransistor from ambient/external light. I've used a (cleaned) bottlecap with holes punched for the phototransistor leads, and that seemed to function well enough. The shield also gives you a surface for attaching tape/other things when mounting the phototransistor to the computer display.

## Software



## Assessment

### Part 1: Communication Latency

Ideally, the duration of communication between the microcontroller and browser should be minimal (i.e. less than a few milliseconds). Any more may affect our ability to discriminate one frame
